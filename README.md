# 🛍️E-commerce Customer Segmentation – MLSC Data Science Graduation Project
******📌 Project Overview:******

This project focuses on customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform using unsupervised machine learning. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, group them into meaningful segments, and provide recommendations for coupon distribution to enhance customer loyalty and satisfaction.

The dataset consists of customer demographics, transaction history, city and gender information, and coupon usage data. We employ clustering techniques to identify customer segments and derive actionable insights for business decision-making.

******🚀 Key Objectives******

1. Feature Engineering: Extract key attributes like customer demographics(e.g., gender, city) and transactional behavior (e.g., coupon usage frequency, transaction status).
2. Clustering Models: Train and evaluate an unsupervised machine learning model (K-Means) for customer segmentation.Ensure to explore different numbers of segments (clusters) and optimize my model for meaningful customer groups.
3. Evaluation: Use Silhouette Score, Inertia, and visualization techniques to determine the best clustering approach.
4. Insights & Recommendations: Analyze segments and suggest strategies for coupon allocation to maximize customer retention.

******📊 Dataset Description******

The dataset consists of five tables:

* Customers: Contains customer_id, join_date, city_id, and gender_id.
* Genders: Maps gender_id to gender names.
* Cities: Maps city_id to city names.
* Transactions: Includes transaction_id, customer_id, transaction_date, transaction_status, coupon_name, burn_date, and branch_id.
* Branches & Merchants: Provide branch and merchant details.
